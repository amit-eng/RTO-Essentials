# 🧠 RTO-Essentials

**Educational Windows malware development concepts for learning purposes**

---

## 📌 Overview

**RTO-Essentials** is a beginner-friendly, educational repository focused on understanding **Windows malware development concepts** from a **learning and defensive perspective**.

This project helps learners understand:

* Windows **PE (Portable Executable)** internals
* How payloads can be stored, encoded, and encrypted
* Why classic injection and execution techniques work
* How attackers think — so defenders can detect and mitigate threats

⚠️ **This repository is NOT intended for real-world attacks or misuse.**

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

* Beginners learning **malware development fundamentals**
* Blue teamers studying **offensive techniques for defense**
* Red team learners building **strong conceptual foundations**
* Students exploring **Windows internals & security**

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **Language:** C / C++
* **Operating System:** Windows x64 / x86
* **Compiler:** `cl.exe` (MSVC)
* **Environment:** Local lab / virtual machine only

## 📘 Module Breakdown

### 🔹 01. Generate PE

Learn how **EXE and DLL files are created**, including:

* Basic PE structure
* Entry point behavior
* Console vs GUI executables

Purpose: Understand how Windows loads executables.

---

### 🔹 02. Payload Storage

Explores **where payloads can be stored inside a PE file**:

* `.text` section
* `.data` section
* `.rsrc` section

Purpose: Learn why defenders inspect PE sections during analysis.

---

### 🔹 03. Payload Encoding

Demonstrates **simple encoding techniques**:

* Obfuscating raw payload bytes
* Avoiding static signatures

Purpose: Understand why encoded payloads are harder to statically analyze.

---

### 🔹 04. Payload Encryption

Introduces **basic encryption concepts**:

* XOR encryption
* AES encryption

Purpose: Learn why encrypted payloads require runtime decryption and how security tools detect them.

---

### 🔹 05. Functions Obfuscation

Covers **API and function hiding concepts**:

* String obfuscation
* Dynamic API resolution

Purpose: Understand how malware avoids static API detection.

---

### 🔹 06. Backdooring PE

Demonstrates **conceptual PE modification techniques**:

* Modifying execution flow
* Injecting logic into existing binaries

Purpose: Learn why file integrity monitoring is critical.

---

### 🔹 07. Code Injection

Explains **classic injection techniques**:

* Shellcode-based execution
* DLL injection (theory-focused)

Purpose: Understand how code executes in remote processes.

---

### 🔹 08. Hiding Console

Explains how malware hides visible artifacts:

* `FreeConsole()` usage
* GUI subsystem tricks

Purpose: Learn how stealth techniques reduce user awareness.

---

### 🔹 XX. Shellcodes

Contains **test shellcodes** (e.g., calc.exe) used only for:

* Debugging
* Learning
* Controlled execution tests

⚠️ No real-world payloads included.

---

## 🛠️ Build Instructions (MSVC)

> ⚠️ Compile and test only in an isolated lab or VM

1. Open **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**
2. Navigate to a module directory
3. Compile using:

```
cl.exe source.c /EHsc
```

4. Execute only in a controlled environment
